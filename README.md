ECE 385 Final Project, FPGA

We used System Verilog to recreate the popular mobile phone game 2048 and display it on a VGA monitor.

Unfortunately for my partner Chris Song and I, we were hit with the coronavirus lockdown midway through the project, but we still managed to complete the project.
For those unfamiliar with 2048, the goal of the game is to combine matching tiles and reach the number 2048. Some of the files from Lab8 are included in the project
because it was the backbone of the project and has not been removed. The project served as an introduction to software and hardware integration as well the difficulties
of developing a video game.
